## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned that you can develop for responsivity without using media queries. I solved this with CSS techniques like calc() and clamp().

```css
.responsive-font-size {
  font-size: clamp(20px, 5vw, 24px);
}
```
